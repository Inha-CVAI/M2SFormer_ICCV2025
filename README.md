## Abstract
Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map‚Äîa curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization‚Äîwhich then guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across unseen domains.

### üîë Key Insights of the Overall Architecture
- _**Unified Multi-Spectral and Multi-Scale Attention**_:
  Instead of processing spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer introduces an M2S Attention Block in the skip connections. This block fuses frequency-domain features (via 2D DCT) and multi-scale spatial cues (SIFT-inspired pyramids), enabling the model to capture both subtle tampering artifacts and diverse forgery patterns across different scales
  
- _**Edge-Aware Difficulty-Guided Decoder**_:
  The decoder integrates a curvature-based global prior map to quantify the ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù of localization. By identifying high-curvature edge regions as perceptually harder, the model transforms this difficulty into a text-based representation and applies Difficulty-Guided Attention (DGA), focusing the Transformer decoder on challenging regions while preserving fine details
  
- _**Balanced Efficiency and Generalization**_:
  By embedding frequency attention within feature maps (not raw inputs) and leveraging a lightweight PVT-v2 backbone, M2SFormer achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computation. This design ensures robust cross-domain generalization while keeping the parameter count (~27M) and FLOPs (~14G) efficient compared to prior frequency- or Transformer-based approaches
  
## Experiment Results

### üîë Key Findings from Experiment Results
- _**Superior Cross-Domain Generalization**_:
  M2SFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen datasets (e.g., Columbia, IMD2020, CoMoFoD, In-the-Wild, MISD). For instance, when trained on CASIAv2, it achieves DSC 58.8 / mIoU 50.8, and when trained on DIS25k, it reaches DSC 87.7 / mIoU 81.5, demonstrating strong robustness across manipulation types and domains
  
- _**Efficiency with Higher Accuracy**_:
  Despite achieving better accuracy, M2SFormer maintains relatively low computational cost‚Äî~27.4M parameters and ~14.2 GFLOPs at 256√ó256 resolution. Compared with models like FBINet and EITLNet, which rely heavily on frequency or dual encoders, M2SFormer strikes a better balance between efficiency and performance
  
- _**Clear Gains from Ablation Studies**_:
  Ablation studies confirm that both multi-spectral + multi-scale fusion and the Edge-Aware DGA decoder are crucial. Removing either significantly degrades unseen-domain performance (e.g., DSC drops from 43.0 ‚Üí 32.3 without DGA). This validates that the joint integration of spectral-spatial attention and difficulty-guided decoding is the main driver of generalization improvements

- _**Real-World Corruption Robustness**_:
  In addition to domain transfer, M2SFormer shows greater resilience to real-world corruptions such as JPEG compression, blurring, and noise, which are common in online tampered images. By leveraging frequency-domain cues (DCT) and curvature-based difficulty guidance, the model preserves boundary fidelity and subtle traces even under degraded conditions, outperforming conventional CNN or single-domain approaches
